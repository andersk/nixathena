      Hesiod is a name service library that can provide general name
      service for a variety of applications. It is derived from BIND,
      the Berkeley Internet Name Daemon, and leverages the existing
      DNS infrastructure of a network. It is used on a number of
      university networks, including MIT and Iowa State University.
